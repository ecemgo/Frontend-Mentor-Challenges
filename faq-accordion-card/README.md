## Working on the project

### Prerequisists

- Nodejs: v18.14.1 (LTS) (Install Nodejs)

### Installing the project

#### The node packages used:

- tailwindcss: v3.2.7
- flowbite: v1.6.3

#### Install the node packages:

- Run command to install project dependencies respectively:

  - `cd faq-accordion-card`
  - `npm install`

**Note:** You need to type the command like this since the `faq-accordion-card` folder is a child of the `frontend-mentor-challenges` folder.

#### Run tests and watch for changes:

`npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./public/styles.css --watch`

**Note:** Apart from the documentation of Tailwind CSS, a `public` directory was created instead of a `dist` directory, and `styles.css` was created instead of `input.css` and `output.css` in the project root; the files in the directory are ready for deployment.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flowbite
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The documentation of Tailwind CSS was used to give the features to the template.
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) - It is the most popular open-source library of interactive UI components built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.
