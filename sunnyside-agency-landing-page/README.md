## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

The `loading` attribute specifies whether a browser should load an image immediately or to defer loading of off-screen images until for example the user scrolls near them.

<b>Tip</b>: Add `loading="lazy"` only to images which are positioned below the fold.

```
  <img src="URL" loading="eager|lazy">
```

<h2>Attribute Values</h2>

| Value | Description                                           |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| eager | Default. Loads an image immediately                   |
| lazy  | Defer loading of images until some conditions are met |
