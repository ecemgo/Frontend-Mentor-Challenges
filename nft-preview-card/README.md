## Working on the project

### Prerequisists

- Nodejs: v18.14.1 (LTS) (Install Nodejs)

### Installing the project

#### The node packages used:

- tailwindcss: v3.2.7

#### Install the node packages:

- Run command to install project dependencies respectively:
  - `cd nft-preview-card`
  - `npm install`

**Note:** You need to type the command like this since the `nft-preview-card` folder is a child of the `frontend-mentor-challenges` folder.

#### Run tests and watch for changes:

`npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles.css -o ./public/styles.css --watch`

**Note:** Apart from the documentation of Tailwind CSS, a `public` directory was created instead of a `dist` directory, and `styles.css` was created instead of `input.css` and `output.css` in the project root; the files in the directory are ready for deployment.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I focused on the following features of Tailwind CSS:

- How to make hover effect
- How to use transition duration
- Using shadows on colored backgrounds
- Using flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - It is used to understand the concept and apply the necessary features.
- [Hover effect on image](https://tailwind-elements.com/docs/standard/components/hover-effects/) - It is used how to make the hover effect on the image called equilibrium.
